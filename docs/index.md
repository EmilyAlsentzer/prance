##  Overview
Our clinical annotation platform is a platform for rapidly annotating medical terms within clinical notes. One can highlight spans of text and map them to concepts in UMLS (or any vocabulary you provide) within a single, intuitive interface. Recommendations and pre-annotations can help speed up the process -- see the demo below!

## Why?
Clinical notes document detailed patient information, including pertinent medical history, procedures performed during a visit, a patient's treatment response, and interpretation of imaging. This data often exists only in unstructured clinical text, and not in any structured fields in the Electronic Health Record. This information can be leveraged for a variety of use cases--from better decision support in EHRs to richer retrospective research--but often exists only in unstructured form in clinical notes, and not in any existing structured data.
