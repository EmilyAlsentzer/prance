## Why?
Clinical notes document detailed patient information, including pertinent medical history, procedures performed during a visit, a patient's treatment response, and interpretation of imaging. This information can be leveraged for a variety of use cases--from better decision support in EHRs to richer retrospective research--but often exists only in unstructured form in clinical notes, and not in any existing structured data.
