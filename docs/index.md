##  Overview
Our clinical annotation platform is a platform for rapidly annotating medical terms within clinical notes. One can highlight spans of text and quickly map them to concepts in large vocabularies within a single, intuitive platform. Users can use the search and recommendation features to find labels without having to leave the interface. Further, the platform can take in suggestions (e.g. from existing labeling systems), and users can accept or modify in a single click to speed up the process. See the demo below!

## Why?
Clinical notes document detailed patient information, including pertinent medical history, procedures performed during a visit, a patient's treatment response, and interpretation of imaging. This information can be leveraged for a variety of use cases--from better decision support in EHRs to richer retrospective research. However, this data often exists only in unstructured clinical text, and not in any structured fields in their health record, which requires manual or automatic extraction from clinical notes.
